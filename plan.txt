Step 1:
Have compute shader make flat plane with color based on x and y coords
- At first just make vertices manually
- Then maybe try generating x/y coords (in 3d space, not clip space) based on instance index?
  - vertices would basically just be colors
  - could calculate colors like this too, I guess
  - save memory, not too much loss to performance, probably

Step 2:
Integrate camera movement (mouse and keyboard control)

Step 3:
Random number generator

Step 4:
Perlin noise height
